# Simpson's 1/3 method
This code uses the Simpson's 1/3 method to estiamte the integral of a function
## Inputs/Outputs
- Inputs:
- x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
- y = the vector of function values with respect to x
- Outputs:
- I = the numerical integral calculated
## How it works
