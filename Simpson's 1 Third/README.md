# Simpson's 1/3 method
This code uses the Simpson's 1/3 method to estimate the integral of a function
## Inputs/Outputs
### Inputs:
- x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
- y = the vector of function values with respect to x
### Outputs:
- I = the numerical integral calculated
## Limitations
- Inputs must be the same length
- X matrix must be equally spaced
## Other Information
This function was not completely finished, and as such may not work for certain situations
