# Mech105-Algorithms
These are the algorithms I created for Mech 105 numerical methods my second semester at CSU
## **Binary Converter**
This code converts a base 10 number into a binary number
## **LU Factorization**
This code breaks a matrix into an upper and lower triangular matrix
## **False Position** 
This code uses the false position method to find the root of a function
## **Simpson's 1/3 Rule**
This code uses the Simpson's 1/3 method to estiamte the integral of a function
