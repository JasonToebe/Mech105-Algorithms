# False Position
This code uses the false position method to find the root of a function
## Inputs/Outputs
### Inputs:
- func = Function to be evaluated
- xl = Lower guess
- xu = Upper guess
- es =  Desired realitive error
- maxit = Maximum number of iterations
- varargin = Any additional perameters
### Outputs:
- root = The calculated root of the function
- fx = The function at the root value
- ea = Approximate error
- iter = Number of iterations
## Limitations
- May not be the most efficient method and may be slow
## Other Information
This algorithum was not extensively tested and as such may not work 100% of the time
