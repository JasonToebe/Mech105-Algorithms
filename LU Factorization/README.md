# LU Factorization
This code breaks a matrix into an upper and lower triangular matrix
## Inputs/Outputs
### Inputs:
- A = coefficient matrix
### Outputs:
- L = lower triangular matrix
- U = upper triangular matrix
- P = the permutation matrix
## Limitations
- Only accepts square matricies
- Does not solve the matrix
## Other Information
This function was not completely finished, and as such may not work for certain situations
